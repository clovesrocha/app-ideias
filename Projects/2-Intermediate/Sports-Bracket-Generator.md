# Sports Bracket Generator

**Tier:** 2-Intermediate

Whether your main sport is soccer, baseball, cricket, or competitive
Esports following the progress of your favorite team during tournaments is an
activity enjoyed by many. 

Tracking team progress is traditionally done using a horizontal tree diagram
showing all of the initial matches on the lefthand side. At the end of each
match the winner advances to the next round in the tournament along with the
winner of the adjacent match. Columns in the diagram are used to represent 
each round and contain one-half of the teams in the adjacent column on the left
and twice as many teams as the adjacent column to the right. The number of 
teams in each column decreases from left to right until the last round
(column) contains the final winner in the tournament.

The SportsBracket Generator automates the process of creating this type of chart by 
drawing it in a browser window to relieve the user from having to draw it by
hand.
