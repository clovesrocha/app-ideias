# Emoji Translator

**Tier:** 2-Intermediate

Emojis have become the _lingua franca_ of modern society. They are a fun and
fast way to communicate, but an also extremely expressive mechanism for
communicating emotions and reactions.

The objective of the Emoji Translator app is to translate text entered by the
user into an equivalent string of emojis, translated from one or more words in
the original text, and words for which there is no corresponding emoji. 

## User Stories

-   [ ] User can enter a string of words, numbers, and punctuation into a text
box
-   [ ] User can click a 'Translate' button to translate words in the entered
text into their corresponding emojis.
-   [ ] User can see a warning message if 'Translate' was clicked, but the 
input text box was empty or unchanged from the last translation.
-   [ ] User can see text elements in the entered text translated to their
equivalent emojis in an output text box. Text elements for which there is no
emoji will be left unchanged.
-   [ ] User can click a 'Clear' button to clear the input and output text boxes.

## Bonus features

-   [ ] Developer will implement an emoji synonym feature to allow the app to
translate a wider variety of words to emoji.

list of languages.
