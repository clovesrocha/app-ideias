# Regular Expression Helper

**Tier:** 2-Intermediate

Regular Expressions should be a valuable part of any developers toolbox. They
provide a concise way to describe a pattern that can be used to test, search, 
match, replace, or split the contents of a 
string. Regular Expressions provide functionality you might otherwise have to
implement using loops and more lines of code.

The Regular Expression Helper helps you learn more about Regular Expressions
by building a useful tool you'll also be able to use to test expressions
you use in your apps.
