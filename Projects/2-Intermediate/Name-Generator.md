# Name generation using Recurrent Neural Networks

**Tier:** 2-Intermediate

Name Generation is nothing more than a sequence of letters that follow certain patterns to create a certain probability density for choosing the next letter in a name.
This App should utilize a RNN model with LSTM/GRUs to ensure highly likeable naming patterns

## User Stories

-   [ ] User can specify the first 2 to 3 letters to be used for the initial name
-   [ ] Use can see the generated name and use it accordingly
