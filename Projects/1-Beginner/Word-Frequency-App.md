# Word Frequency

**Tier:** 1-Beginner

Calculating the frequency of words in a block of text is a technique which has
various uses in algorithms such as searching, sorting, and semantic analysis.
The objective of the Word Frequency app is count the frequency of words in a
block of text and create a tabular display of each unique word in the text
along with its frequency, in descending order by frequency.

## User Stories

-   [ ] User can see a text input box, a 'Translate' button, and a word
        frequency table.
-   [ ] User can enter text (or cut and paste) into the input box. This input
        box must allow the entry of large blocks of text (maximum of 2048 characters).
-   [ ] User can click the 'Translate' button to analyze the word frequency in
        the text that has been input.
-   [ ] User can see an error message if the text input box is empty.
-   [ ] User can see the word frequency table populated when the 'Translate'
        button is clicked. Each row in the table contains a word and the number of times
        it occurs in the input text.
-   [ ] User can see the word frequency table ordered in descending sequence
        by word frequency.

## Bonus features

-   [ ] User can see a graphical representation of the word frequency in a
        bubble chart, column chart, or any other form of graphical representation the
        developer chooses.
-   [ ] User may choose to enter the URL of a web page whose content is to be
        analyzed instead of manually entering text. (Hint: See the
        [Podcast Directory](../2-Intermediate/Podcast-Directory-App.md) application for ideas).
