# Recipe

**Tier:** 1-Beginner

You might not have realized this, but recipe's are nothing more than culinary
algorithms. Like programs, recipes are a series of imperative steps which,
if followed correctly, result in a tasty dish.

The objective of the Recipe app is to help the user manage recipes in a way
that will make them easy to follow. 

### Constraints

- For the initial version of this app the recipe data may be encoded as a
JSON file. After implementing the initial version of this app you may
expand on this to maintain recipes in a file or database.

## User Stories

-   [ ] User can see a list of recipe titles
-   [ ] User can click a recipe title to display a recipe card containing the
recipe title, meal type (breakfast, lunch, supper, or snack), number of people
it serves, its difficulty level (beginner, intermediate, advanced), the list
of ingredients (including their amounts), and the preparation steps.
-   [ ] User click a new recipe title to replace the current card with a new
recipe.

## Bonus features

-   [ ] User can see a photo showing what the item looks like after it has
been prepared.
-   [ ] User can search for a recipe not in the list of recipe titles by
entering the meal name into a search box and clicking a 'Search' button. Any
open source recipe API may be used as the source for recipes (see The MealDB
below).
