# Weather App

**Tier:** 1-Beginner

A weather application to get the temperature, weather condition and whether it is day or night of a particular city using `accuweather`. A free weather api.

## User Stories

- [ ] Enter the name of a city into the `input` field.
- [ ] By pressing enter, the user submits the name of the city which updates the `DOM` with the temperature, weather condition, image of day or night and weather condition icon.

## Bonus features

- [ ] By closing the browser window the city name will be stored in localStorage and when the user returns, the name will be retrieved to make an api call to update the `DOM`.
