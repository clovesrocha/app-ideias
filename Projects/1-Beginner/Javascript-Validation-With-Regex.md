# Javascript Validation With Regex

**Tier:** 1-Beginner

In this challenge, you'd create a javascript validation script to validate the inputs entered by a user using RegEx.

You could always refer to the [Regular Expression Library](http://regexlib.com/(X(1)A(GijS7qxVy-6Gyc4cweUyFoK4ZvRn2WnlOe8SSKuq9sT7ps-2nbiTmZZMTCn_rFk4-mNoGnYL-DPU8pJhmNNOtkP-syqWE4WO_1aVt4bPa5nTsQPQe6VRAALnm6QW3YIWbYkVS78JFbZN39vmMI1UYiWlHXKwNMB99WjsZOn0qc_8dcN0unp2KMOBw0P__3OH0))/CheatSheet.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1) for support

For this project, there'd be three required inputs for validation:
- The first would require the user to enter five (5) capital letters, six (6) symbols and two hyphens (-) in any order. This could be used as a password.
- The second which could be used as username would require the user to enter letters without spaces
- The third which could be used as email address would require the user to enter only email addresses on gmail (...@gmail.com).

## User Stories

-   [ ] User should be notified of any invalid inputs by error messages displayed on the form.
-   [ ] The submit button on the form would never be executed until all entries are validated.
