# Key Value

**Tier:** 1-Beginner

Have you ever thought about what it means that the computer you are using is
a digital device? Among other things it means that everything its capable of
is achieved by translating a digital signal into a sequence of binary digits - 0's and 1's. These binary digits form codes used to represent data. 

The keyboard you used to retrieve this project description is a great example
of this. Pressing a key generates a digital signal that is translated by the
computer into a code representing the key that was pressed.

The goal of the Key Value app is to display the encoded value on screen each
time a key is pressed on the keyboard.
